# This project uses Next.JS

It was originally built as a Vite + React project.

**TODO:**

    - ...

**Past Issues:**
    - no logos appearing due to forgotten json parse required due to longtext storage in mariadb
    - Tailwind on Roadmap page... Checkmarks and empty circles (FontAwesomeIcon 's) works when set to "min-h-[30px] max-w-[20px]"
      but not when using "w-[20px] h-[30px]"...???? Have left as solution, but will wonder why..?
